110-117
maybe 113-118

it doesn’t matter how many res you do
decent # would be cool

let’s do 110-117, want to be realistic
can always sample tuples since they are pruned independently…
cut down if desired


flex res will be key wt contact
since it would be sil to pretend this is really an ab initio system, rather sort of recapping cxcl12/cxcr4

mutable res and their rots & main sidechain contacts:

110: Asp; 175/-87; 112,224,225 NOTE THIS IS ACROSS DIMER
111: Asn; -172/-27; 3
112: Tyr; -173/67/-135; 10,27,29,110
113: Thr; -54/-26; solvent
114: Glu; 50/175/62; 2 (may also not mutate bc lots of solvent?)
115: Glu; -172/-179/57; 48 (&ditto?)
116: Met; -63/-176/63; 47
117: Gly
118: Ser; -55/47; 15,50
